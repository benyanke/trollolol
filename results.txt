Public Schools suck! All the kids there are stupid idiots...except my kid! He's so smart! Fighting the good fight in the middle of all those idiots!

1) Make up a quote for your opposition.

2) Call them racist for having said it in your imagination

Kind of like when my wife woke up mad at me because she dreamed I had an affair.
WHY THE FUCK IS LAMAR SMITH ON ALL THE DAMN BOARDS?!? I HATE THAT FUCKER!

Or maybe he is one of the poor saps who believes the Republican party is still respectable. The GOP prior to the 1980s actually had a sense of sanity. People who believe in a small federal government need to abandon ship from the GOP. A party that consistently advocates defense spending every year, and introduces laws that hurt voting rights, women's rights, gay rights, abortion righs, etc etc are not the party of small government.

The problem is they can get away with it, how do you "kick out" politicians who have legions of idiots who eat this shit up and vote for them? They wouldn't peddle it if it didn't sell. I used to ask myself the same thing about Germany, how could the people be so stupid to let Hitler get power, now in modern America as an older person I understand exactly how it happens.

Britain is not perfect, and we have a conservative government who are doing a lot of damage to our country right now... but I am unbelievably fucking grateful that I do not live in America right now.

I've lately been getting the horrible sense that America could be walking into, if not a typical dictatorship, some kind of totalitarian governance. I wouldn't expect it to be quite the same as anything else the world has seen before, but there are lots of signs and the conditions are ripe for some seriously dangerous political realities to emerge. 

Laws that violate the public's privacy, freedoms and basic rights have been springing up in the last decade along with an increasingly polarized electorate. The economy is fucked and the level of extremism in the Republican party is down right frightening. As much as I hate the conservatives in the UK, they are no where even fucking *near* as scary as Americans. Our conservatives seem just genuine in their views but with decent arguments (not as I personally see them) for their cause. The republicans - some like Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Santorum seem either sociopathic or psychologically fucked in one way or another. Mitt Romney especially - I'd go as far as saying pathological lying - and that's not being politically biased. You can see a whole host of videos of him stating his support for various issues, then on another occasion outright denying that he'd ever held those views. That's not normal behaviour ladies and gentlemen. He does it with no apparent embarrassment of difficulty in spite of clear evidence to the contrary. I've known a real sociopath and that's exactly like how they lie. Pathological lying is such, because it doesn't matter what their subject knows. Whether or not Mitt Romney is actually a sociopath (a clinical diagnosis should be required in fairness), a politician should not be able to act like that publicly without consequence. He should not be taken seriously. Mitt Romney would have been laughed out of politics in the UK the moment he tried stepping into it. I have dire concerns for America. I think it's in serious danger right now, and if I was living there I'd be making every effort to get the hell out of the country. Sorry, but America is not the best/most free country in the world. Seriously, watch your backs. :(

Well, this may true of some *conservative* Christians, but it is important to remember that many tens of millions of liberal Christians in the United States and elsewhere find a way to reconcile evolutionary biology with their religious beliefs.

Since so many Christians are liberals, I think religion does a poor job of explaining conservative behavior overall, and so we must be cautious about assigning any unidirectional arrows of causation between the two.

Have you seen the republican house by any chance?

Think them, plus an actual President in the white house prepared to pass their (arguably nefarious) bills.

America, please forgive me but you guys do let some amount of fucking retards into power. 

Most Americans I have ever known (and I knew lots - I grew up there) are no where near this idiotic, so I do believe there's hope. But what is the solution? How do you as a nation cure and transcend this cancer of your political system?

I'll have you know, being a scientist and all, that the Earth being in orbit around the Sun is a lie straight from the pit of hell. There's actually a lot of science now that I've found that says that the Earth is flat, and that the Sun evaporates at the end of each day. In the morning, it is "born again", like me!

Like it or not, this is democracy. While this person clearly seems to be an idiot and possibly delusional, he was democratically elected by the people of Georgia. 

Don't be mad at Paul Broun...well actually still be mad, but the real blame lies with those that elected him into office.

Dont forget he didn't claim this was going to be revenue neutral so this is going to go straight to the deficit.

That 20% tax drop he claims is somehow going to magically be rev neutral. But he said nothing about that defense increase being rev neutral. 
Romney's tax plan is a straw man for everyone but the ~7% of people who can grasp the scale of numbers we're dealing with here. As is Obama's.

Anyone who believes that our current spending in any area (war, especially -- which makes up 1/3rd to 1/2 of debt spending -- depending on how you view past expenditures and debt servicing)

Anyway... the point is that neither candidate will cut shit. Mark it on your calendar, revisit in 4y.

Both candidates are slaves to the banks, military-industrial-complex, and crony-corporate complex. The difference is less than 1%.

I wish that Obama had responded to this in a slightly more forceful manner.  Romney made it out to be like he was the true patriot - that Obama wants to somehow weaken us.

"My opponent seems to think that he can convince the American public that we can only be safe if we throw more money at our military.  Our military keeps trying to hand that money back to us, but Mr Romney thinks he knows better what they need - and just wants to dump more money on them that they don't want.  Don't let him fool you.  This is not an act of patriotism - it's just an irresponsible attempt to play on the fear we all sometimes feel when we think about the dangers that our country faces.  But at a time when everyone is struggling - at a time we're trying to rebuild our economy and tighten our belts against government waste - shouldn't we take our own military's advice and consider using that 2 trillion dollars in a more responsible way?  

I love this country, and protecting it is my highest priority.  I would never do anything to weaken our military - and i take the advice of the military leaders very seriously.  Is Mr Romney so arrogant that he thinks he can ignore their suggestions?"

Ok - i'm sure someone could put that a bit more eloquently, but if i can come up with that on the fly, couldn't Obama?
&gt; The neo-con theory on the Navy is that it is the most potent expression of American hard power.

How is that a 'neo-con theory'? It's clearly a fact. 
As i have always said, speculation about any sort of open hostility between the West and China is silly and naive because both sides are very deeply integrated with each other. Any sort of warfare be it economical or military will be a No-win situation for EVERYONE. China is *not* the Soviet Union.

The military never asks for money. The Representatives in Congress try to increase spending in the industrial military complex in order to please constitutes who work in those fields - army bases, weapons manufacturing,  etc., in their districts.

You start by asking for $2 trillion and then settle for $500 billion after deliberations. That is what usually happens.

But hey, you seem to be having a lot of fun getting hot under the collar over shit that has not happened yet. Knock yourselves out, hopefully you will get a good nights sleep from all your hoopla.

We have the complete list of Romney's flip-flops on our website here: www.romneyflop.com/by-topic. Share the site with your friends... especially any voters that are still undecided. It's hard to imagine that anyone could look at this list (with sources) of all the times Romney flip-flopped and still vote for him.
You know that Ted is long dead right? His fat drunken ass (and folds in his face) are rotting underground where he belongs. Reminds me...I think I'll go piss on his grave tomorrow sweet Jesus.  Not to mention that poor girl he murdered. 
So they had plenty of votes to attach an amendment to ObamaCare raising the minimum wage to a LIVING WAGE. But Democrats didn't do that.

Thanks for making that plainly obvious.

Democrats NEED people to remain poor. So that's what they did. *They kept poor people poor.*

Lieberman is an Independent, and his favorite pastime is poking Democrats in the fucking eye. 

I don't think 'filibuster-proof' fits, especially since Lieberman held up the ACA bill several times by threatening to vote against it, unless changes were made that he wanted. 

That doesn't sound like a very strong coalition to me... and don't even get me started on the Blue Dogs, or, as we called them in the old days, 'Republicans'.

You are referring to a quote stating that the President has *put in place* as much public debt as all other presidents combined.  Even if you include 2009 and drop 2013, you would be inaccurately attributing $500billion more in debt to Obama, which is hardly nontrivial. 
He did clarify himself to say almost as much, not quite double, and I'd say that 90% would qualify as "almost as much".

And while the issue with the starting date is valid, I'd say that most would interpret the statement as 'during your term, the debt accrued is equal to all other president's combined' or something similar. The President doesn't have as much control as candidates imply in the debates, but in the context of a debate in which candidates claim to be able to directly create or have directly created millions of jobs, it's not particularly notable.

Edit: Haha botched some numbers. It's early and I haven't had my coffee yet... sorry. But I fixed them. 

&gt; **Too** - *adverb* - to an excessive extent or degree; Example: *too sick to travel.*

- $3.8 Trillion in spending. 

- $2.3 Trillion in revenue

- $1.5 Trillion in new debt (deficit)

That brings us over $16 Trillion in debt. That's over $50,000 for every man woman and child in America. I don't know about you... But I don't have an extra 50k lying around for myself let alone each of my kids! The government has been spending more than it has been taking in for over a decade. Obama promised he would (at the very least) slow it down. He hasn't.  

Therefore, the government spent "to an **objectively** excessive extent".

Therefore, the government spent too much. &lt;-- Fact.

That is *nonsense*, pure and simple. Clearly the new, radicalized Democratic Party has their own conception of "the facts". It's like how Gov. Romney called out Obama during the debate, "Mr. President, you are entitled to your own car and house, but not to your own facts." BOOM!

Anyway, this radicalization of one of America's two parties is the biggest problem with today's politics. While one party has stayed largely centrish, the other has moved to a nearly-extremist ultra-left position. There's a huge gulf in the political spectrum now, with one side absolutely refusing to compromise on issues such as the federal govt overpowering all aspects of American life.

This issue, actually a Democrat strategy guided by a near-Marxist ideology, involves the complete dismantling of the American way and the American dream. The resulting "Big Government" sticks its tendrils in business, education, religion and healthcare (to name a few), all the while destroying any sense of freedom and individualism. It is this expansion of govt (primarily under Obama) that has doubled our deficit.

Um... no they are not read it again: "The debt held by the public -- one of two key measures of federal debt -- rose from $6.3 trillion on Jan. 20, 2009, to $11.3 trillion on the day of the debate, an increase of 79 percent. The total federal debt, which includes debt the government holds itself, rose by a smaller amount over that period, 53 percent." the important part is "The debt held by the public -- one of two key measures of federal debt" and " The total federal debt, which includes debt the government holds itself, rose by a smaller amount over that period, 53 percent." the 53 percent comes from the debt on the debt clock which represents total federal debt, which was 10.8ish trillion in beginning of 2009 and 16.1ish trillion as of now which is roughly 53% I'm sure if you work out the math on more accurate numbers it will be around 53 %.

"Fiscal Year" 2009 began on October 1st, 2008, and the budget for FY2009 was planned &amp; passed in advance, under Bush's leadership. 

The CBO projections of FY2009's deficit being ~1.1 trillion were done &amp; released prior to Obama taking office in late Jan. 2009, at which time nearly 4 months of FY2009 were already behind us. 

Using FY 2008 data for such a claim becomes incredibly deceptive as it effectively pins all the effects of the financial collapse &amp; economic recession onto Obama, even though it took place while Bush was at the helm.

WOAH THIS TITLE IS MISLEADING.

Scalia says it's a no-brainer that states can ban conduct if a majority of the electorate think it's a serious violation of their moral codes. He NEVER said outlawing is a no brainer; just that it's a no brainer that states get to decide morality if they want to.

Edit: To clarify, Scalia thinks morality is sufficient for rational basis review; he does not seem to think it sufficient for intermediate or strict scrutiny. So morality is a good enough reason for laws that discriminate against the elderly, but not for laws that discriminate against blacks or women.

To me the most damning quote from him, and the one that, to me, says he can no longer act in a partial manor is this one

"Nobody ever thought the Constitution prevented restrictions on abortion"

That is so absurd. his logic here is that because the constitution doesn't specifically state you can or can't impose restrictions on something then that means you can.

He has completely thrown out the whole essence and reason for the constitution with that attitude. The constitution was written in a way so that it could, in the future be amended and updated to rule on something the original writers may have not included or were unable to foresee. 

Our founding fathers understood that they were not perfect, and as such any document or rules they created were not going to be perfect either. They understood that the document should not be used and applied as if it is infallible. They realized that there will be conflicts, that there would be situations that arise that the constitution does not address.

And so, they wrote into the constitution the ability to change it to reflect changing conditions.

In fact, they would see Scalia's view of the constitution as abhorrent. This also goes back to the whole christian nation fallacy. The founding fathers were NOT christian. Many of them were Deists an humanists.

In fact Thomas Jefferson, the author of the declaration of independence, owned a copy of the bible that he had edited and annotated to fit how he viewed the world and God.

If you were to suggest Scalia's ideas to Thomas Jefferson, he would say that those were the very ideas that this nation was founded to get AWAY FROM. They wanted to get away from the absolute athority of the crown of England. The idea that the constitution is absolute violates the very idea of a free nation. They rebeled against those absolutes in a King, and now the very document they created to avoid that kind of rule has been twisted and used to justify absolutes.

To me, Scalia no longer understands the very document he is meant to uphold, and he now represents everything this nation was founded to get away from.

He should be disbarred for his remarks lest this country no longer represent the founding fathers ideals.

**TL;DR      Scalia has perverted the intent of the constitution and the ideals that the founding fathers created this nation on.**

&gt; In fact Thomas Jefferson, the author of the declaration of independence, owned a copy of the bible that he had edited and annotated to fit how he viewed the world and God.

Most Christians don't even bother to deface it before drawing a whacky interpretation from it.

But if corporations are inherently included in "freedom of speech" why would we need a separate freedom of the press?  We have interpreted, of course, that speech includes printed materials.
Their judicial interpretation involves them to trying to read the minds of dead people, sound familiar?

I feel like it's important to note that he is saying the Constitution leaves these matters up to each individual State to decide. Doesn't make him right though.

The SC is a completely outdated institution. It doesn't pass the smell test. Five members could dine on toxic meat &amp; the result could be one president deciding the future for 40 years. It's stupid &amp; fails design 101.

just my opinion:

Anyone saying anything as important, complex and wide ranging as restricting civil rights of only certain people (guilty of what appears to be the one unforgiveable sin - since even John Wayne Gacy could get married) or of deciding where the limits are with respect to government control of a person's body (abortion or killing them for their crimes) things this is a trivial 'no-brainer' decision they are either:

1) idealogues and already convinced without hearing the case or

2) mentally incompetent and unable to properly render judgement

neither of which is suitable for a justice of the Supreme Court.

Note that this applies to both sides of those discussions.

Agreed and the main problem is that they're gambling with the future of this country and the very substance that keeps this country safe and sovereign.

They are doubling down on the security of ever man, woman and child in America and the future of all of them. Just so they can wave a flag in the face of some uneducated southern fool and say, 'Yay! We defeated the black, muslim, kenyan witch doctor and his communist/socialist/facist agenda!'

It's utter and blatant ignorance and I'm sick of people defending it and suggesting that it's not a form of terrorism and a direct threat to this country.

Dramatic? Yes. But what else do you call it when the people in charge who are supposed to be fixing things are purposefully making them *worse* and causing the very ramifications that we're trying to escape as a nation.?
Oh, you betcha. 

I'm willing to bet all I have that the people that voted for these republicans are the same that both watch Fox News, and vote republican to "keep those damn dirty lib'rulz outta my gubbmint". They either don't know or don't care about what's actually happening, and it makes me so incredibly frustrated.
Boehner controls the House and thus the CSPAN camera feed, so he had the cameras shut off in advance to avoid anybody seeing this happen.  If anybody is "posturing" its the Republicans, and they are doing so to hide the fact they're complete obstructionists.

That's exactly what happened.  The democrats did the exact same thing about a year ago? (I'm not sure exactly when it was), and I'm sure it happened before that as well.  These sessions are called "[pro forma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_forma#United_States)" and are not for introducing/passing bills, so someone shows up and yells and screams and acts like a victim for the camera because most people are completely ignorant on how congress actually works.

Good. Its important for these righteous Republicans too keep the Democrats in check.

I am disappoint. I expected something that would make my head hurt, not basic logic/calculus applied to explain the concept of error in missile guidance systems. 

0/10 would not bang
Anyone that fact checks has to be slanted towards the left. We know that the right will not pay attention to fact checkers and let them decide if they are lying or not. Since the fact checkers report when the right lies, they must be slanted towards the left no matter how many times they also say that the left lies.
And the same group that claims FOX polls are biased towards democrats.

These are the same people that say...

1. Obama was not born in America
2. Obama is a muslim
3. Obama is an atheist
4. Every single poll but Rasmussen is lying all the time
5. That, by their logic, John Kerry should have taken the presidency in 2004 with his crushing debate wins over Bush 3 times in a row

What do you expect, really?

Kerry really did demolish Bush, especially in the first debate. Didn't make a difference.

You truly live in a fantasy world. Quit reading BS websites. BS in, BS out. Vote Obama.
Says the weed baked retard.  I find it so hilarious that I know 100X more about your precious Kenyan and his antics than you parasitic hippies that worship in his direction 5 times a day.

You poor stupid libs don't take being introduced to reality very well do you?  I apologize for ruining your blissful circlejerk comrade.

Tell me then Tony, why is every BLS statistic eventually "revised?"
It aint conspiracy when its right.
Again, 191k Jobs added in July (over 200k people entered work force though) and the U-3 didnt budge.
170k added in August, U-3 didn't budge.  Same 200k entered work force.
Now only 114k added in September and U-3 drops .4?  Same 200k people entering work force.  Who's dumb here?  The people who do math, or some government shill retard?
 
Why? What kind of sense does that make? How about this, anyone who says that anyone that says "good grief" should not be listened to, should not be listened to. It makes exactly the same amount of sense as what you just said, none at all. Let's not reduce ourselves to silly baseless arguments when we have no other recourse. It makes us look foolish.

We are fully prepared for the zombie apocalypse. We'll use our extensive arsenal to take out the undead, or the merly braindead - if they chose to attack of course.

Nice anecdotes! I know a shitload of conservatives. They hunt, they hike, they've been through multiple tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. I may not be all that conservative, but I'm hardly naive enough to call them pussies. My guess is you wouldn't say it to their faces either.
