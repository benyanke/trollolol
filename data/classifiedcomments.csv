1,"&gt;&gt;If a woman wants to give up a child for adoption with a named father, she is unable to do so without the father's consent.

&gt;That is easy enough to do. Simply don't name the father.

Women are *only* not financially responsible *if* there is no named father. If the father isn't named, he's not on the hook for child support either, so *it doesn't matter*.

You're deliberately removing context and responding to sentences that go together to form an overall argument separately in a way that does not make sense. At this point you're being intentionally misleading to twist this into what you want it to be instead of actually participating in the spirit of the argument. "

When it comes to genetics, people are downright idiotic about it. I inherited a bunch of stuff from my mom that is expensive, painful, and will bother me my entire life. Luckily I have good insurance. I had an autoimmune disease as a kid that almost killed me. If I were trying to create healthy, happy babies, I would not have suggested my parents get together, given the history of depression and early degenerative joint disease on both sides.

If they do re-introduce blueprints like Legacy I imagine mutants as being more appropriate for abandoned buildings and loot points; cannibalistic bands pushed to the edge of society, inhabiting old ruins and maybe even one or two caves.

 [**Brutalist architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist%20architecture): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Brutalist architecture__ is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descended from the [modernist architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) movement of the early 20th century. The term does not derive from the word ""brutal"", but originates from the French *béton brut*, or ""raw concrete"", a term used by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [British architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom) critic [Reyner Banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyner_Banham) adapted the term into ""brutalism"" (originally ""New Brutalism"") to identify the emerging style.

&gt;Brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia. Examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete) construction, or in the case of the ""brick brutalists"" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.

&gt;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. ""Brutalism"" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. More recently, ""brutalism"" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular – as a synonym for ""brutal"" – making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.

Weekly sleepovers turned to monthly Skype calls (and the occasional Facebook message), the 7-hour difference was hard for us. Then just last year (2013), I moved to WA (mom got remarried here). The 9-hour difference was tougher. She had a boyfriend and new friends, I had a boyfriend and new friends. We grew into different interests (she was more into partying, I was more into LoL and DnD) and... yeah. I miss her, though. We send each other a message once or twice a month asking how each other is but nothing really more than that."

Also, looking at the color pattern of Nick Nolte's disco overalls on the right, they should have had both of these guys wearing them (with Eddie Murphy wearing a brown shiny nylon dress shirt to compliment the beige shiny nylon dress shirt of Nick Nolte). That would show that the overalls  could work for either of the two featured skin colors. It would be a very 1970 thing to do, hitting the nexus point between progressive, blunt, and awkward. "

1,"Bugs I've noticed since the patch that really piss me off:

* Clicking on a spawn location and either 1) spawning underground in a completely different location, 2) spawning in the middle of nowhere, 3) dropping out of the sky and falling to your death.. in the middle of nowhere.
* Random invisible walls blocking shots when I have a clear line of sight. Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall. Wtf?
* Severe server lag. I'm talking, dying to people after I've killed them. I also killed somebody with an EM6 after I had already died and switched loadouts to a GD7-F. Movement seems warpy, people moving extra fast. It feels as though the server is trying to ""catch up"" and suddenly moves the player models forward extra fast. 
* Been having the cloak glitch a lot. When infil, it gets stuck in this weird half-cloaked phase and I can't tell if I'm really cloaked or not. On HA, I occasionally get stuck glowing even when my shield is off.
* Invisible people. Many invisible people. And no, I'm not talking about infils.
* I'm sure there's more, I just can't remember them."

1,"What an interesting question! I would have to say... We don't know. We know there are two pigments essentially a brown and red pigment that make up hair color. I'm pretty sure that the amount of red is controlled by 1 gene ( but MANY different alleles. ) We are not sure how many genes are involved in the amount of brown pigment. We just don't know enough to be able to predict offspring hair color. 

Disclosure: I am an undergrad in Bio and am not 100% current on hair color inheritance research! =p There may be more up to date info out there.

1,"The League Cup is contested by all teams in the English Football League system (PL, Championship, Leagues 1 and 2) and it runs from August to February. The semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into Extra time and penalties if required.

The FA Cup is contested by every professional football club in both England and Wales and it runs from August to May. However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter. 

Eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper). 

Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties. 

Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley. 

Long post but there you go. The League Cup isn't taken as seriously by bigger teams (hence why Sunderland, Swansea, Bradford, Cardiff and Birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years) but the FA Cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history.  "

1,"Sure, but you would have to manually raise the strainer to keep it above beer level. Sounds like a pain to me when there's easier methods. I like to keep my attention on making sure the in-going side of the siphon is safely above the yeast cake/trub while racking. It seems like this would be hard to do without two people with the strainer method as your attention would be on the strainer.

1,"If only MonoCorp sells X, then you have two options:

1. MonoCorp is selling X at a good enough price and quality, therefore you don't have competition. How is this bad? If no entrepreneur successfully competes against Mono-Corp that means no entrepreneur thinks it can produce a better product than MonoCorp. It's as good as it gets. Rejoice.

2. Monopoly Corp is selling X at a price and quality that people complain about, therefore an entrepreneur starts a competitor. Monopoly no more. If the competitor fails, see #1. If it succeeds, monopoly no more forever."

1,"I've stuck with Coval as my go-to vendor since coming across them relatively early on in my vaping journey due to the 2x30ml/$20 Flavor of the Week specials' incentive and the quality of the liquids I've received through those promotions. Some of them aren't nearly favorites and I've also found some blends that I wouldn't have otherwise picked up that have turned out to be top ranking;  actually this week's [FOTW](http://www.reddit.com/r/ecig_vendors/comments/2qxcrd/buttery_nipple_and_pbb_cream_flavors_of_the_week/) are a couple of greats IMO. My favorites have changed up from time to time, currently I'm really liking 'Trails' the most (think trail mix) but I'm also enjoying getting to know '[Discovery](http://covalvapes.com/collections/artisan-series/products/discovery)'  it's new to me but I foresee it could become a contender before too long. The truth is Coval has exceeded my expectations and some of the blame for my not having tried [TVC](http://thevaporchef.com/), [Cyclops](http://www.cyclopsvapor.com/), [Keystone](http://keystonevapor.com/), [DBLiquids](http://www.dbliquids.com/), [Bombies](http://bombies.com/) or [Grizzly Vapes] (http://www.steammonkey.com/Default.asp) rests with Coval for providing those tasty vapes with competitive pricing, quick shipping and receptive, responsive customer service. I do feel I owe it to myself to try these and some other vendors, at the same time I feel like 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' and everything seems to be working well:)  I do enjoy seeing y'all recommending and promoting each other around these parts and hearing tell of your positive actions in the ecr and larger vaping community. Thanks for getting us the goods and the way you've gone about it!

TLDR;I like Coval's [Trails] (http://covalvapes.com/collections/cloud-series/products/trails). Go JuiceTeam Force!"
1,I'd suggest a time Machine and go back to the early 2000's when it was on Toonami. I honestly don't know where you can find it online. It's worth the watch though.

1,"When we made love the first time after my surgery for ovarian cancer I wore a lacy camisole to cover my huge ugly scar, because I was so self-conscious about how it looked. The first thing he did was to slowly pull up my top and kiss along entire length while telling me how beautiful I was. It was really romantic to me because he was so sincere; later on he told me that he likes the scar because it means that I survived :-)"

He tried to decline (head still turned away) but I insisted.  He finally took the seat in resignation, looked up at me as he sat down and muttered ""I'm not even that old :("".  He was probably in his early-mid fourties.

Since then, I've developed a small anxiety when I'm on the bus and someone of dubious age hops on and stands near me, especially if it's an older woman.

0,"It's a really good printer, but not without it's own issues.  The biggest irritation to me was PLA leaking from the hotend, but a fan duct printed and installed that put airflow across the heat sink on the head fixed the issue.

You can see from most of the comments already that the theme with the TAZ is frustration yet in the end they're glad they went with it.  Once you do find the sweet spot though it's a beast of a printer that has no problems printing 24/7.  In fact Lulzbot prints 24/5 with over a hundred of them.  As /u/jebba said in another thread there's a new all metal hotend very close to production likely about the same time as their new mini printer.  I'm sure the TAZ 5 will have the improvements such as the self leveling system and new hotend.

I can't say anything really bad about Makerbot's 2/2x.  They have their own issues but once you work on them a bit they're solid workhorses.  The 5th gens... stay away for now.

MakerGear M2 is a really solid printer.  I know a few people who own them and if you look at 3dhub's guide the printer is very well liked.

A printer I would highly suggest is an Ultimaker 2.  It has a smaller build volume than the TAZ but it's far less picky with settings.  It's my first choice when printing most of the time just because it works with minimal fuss and can print faster at the same quality levels.  With ninjaflex and composite ninjaflex/ABS parts the TAZ wins hands down though.

If you can accept the build volume the Flashforge Creator Pro is a nice choice and very well built.  Any part that has a higher potential failure rate is easy to replace and spares are on their site.  It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to documentation though."

0,I was top masters before I stopped playing a bit ago and came back and was demoted to gold. That doesn't really bother me but the climb to masters is fucking brutal nowadays. I feel like its not unreasonable to ask that I can be promoted to masters before my MMR reaches GM level.
0,"I would ditch the Pulse Laser personally. If you're good enough to hit with a Rail Gun effectively, I would toss another fixed weapon on your second fire group.

The Pulse Laser on the same fire group as your Beam is probably dragging your Beam down.

Do you run with full power to weapons when you're firing the Beam?

Also, if you want to make much less trips back for ammo, just try a 1 BL, 2 MC setup. Or, depending on how you fly, you can BnZ with 3 heavy thermal weapons.
Rush in, dump all your weapon energy on the ship, fly out and recharge, repeat. If they start to jump, just use all your energy on a constant stream from your main Beam."

0,Was it an E39 though ?
0,That is pretty smooth.
0,10/10 shit my pants then laughed really hard 
0,"I'm spending my second ever nye alone. The first I spent alone my husband was deployed. This time I followed the rabbit too far down the hole of depression. Cleaning today has helped but I'm on the east coast and it's night now and night time is when I get scared. I had a rough road to this point but desperately don't want to go in to the new year still living in it. I'm trying to beat the monster but my family is 900 miles away at least and my friends are out of town so I'm here, on reddit eating a chicken pot pie because my thawed chicken breasts turned sour. Oh hi rabbit hole... bye rabbit hole."
0,"neither, a crack head"
0,*She nods a bit.* Thanks..
0,Woah....
0,"At this point, you haven't told us what the ISIS demands are. Maybe if they are rational enough .. some or all of them might be met. If they are totally irrational as we can only assume, the world leaders give them the big finger and start shipping Muslim immigrants back to their home nations. "
0,"Looks like you also lost about 15 years, looking young."
0,Thank you! I'll take a look at that.
0,The correct answer is clearly Jon's final DwD chapter.
0,"Thanks, but I'm not sure where would I feed the lists I have so Python could generate a new one. But it really looks like what I want."
0,Why would you even post it if you're only going to describe it as crap you karma grubbing asshole 
0,I think I fixed the heat.
0,I believe they blacklist the phone if you keep it 
0,"I never understood the attitude of cops to reprimand people.

Their job is to enforce the law, not warn you that they may enforce the law.

I understand they have lots of leeway, but they aren't our masters or parents."
0,Looking forward to her career in 2015 and beyond!
0,"If you can max the game out then it is some nice eye candy, otherwise pass it up for now"
0,"We're getting brigaded by SRD and SRSSucks

Oh boy! "
0,31st of Dec or 1st of Jan? Happy birthday anyway :)
0,Thank you for this. I never thought I would be able to play Thomas was Alone ever

0,"I didn't say anything about present day dungeons in what you were responding to (despite me believing that).  I said 2.0 runs.  My initial post said they destroy them in speed runs, which they do from what I've seen.  If you parse in the latest extreme dungeons, WHM is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  My runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled SCH's in game.  If I wasn't at work I'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests; but I'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  The best new dungeon to speed run is Qarn imho.  The worst being Snowcloak (due to constant forced stops).

And while I'm not saying it's impossible, I never saw a group with SCH instead of WHM clear faster than 10-11 minutes in WP back then.  Compared to 8:15 runs and 7:30 runs by fcmates, that's about three minutes."

You can just imagine the ill-informed conversations going on in that line of like-minded and scared people. How they were affirming and amplifying each others' impression of the situation. Any minute now, that guy in the center is gonna start jumping up and down making monkey sounds."

0,"It's incredibly naive of you to think that the mother's going to pick *this* as the time to renounce the one, the only thing that can comfort her about the tragic death of her own child. She's not going to ""respect"" her son by having his death rob her of the only thing that will ever let her sleep at night again. She's going to respect him by defying the most savagely accurate versions of her superstitions, and you show a degenerate moral character by portraying this as some kind of aberration on her part. "

0,"Yes in 7680x1440 I can get 100fps in the games I've tried so far. I've only got the extra 2 monitors a month ago, but so far I've ran Assetto Corsa, iRacing, Insurgency, starbound, Next Car Game, Dishonored, Civ5, Path of Exile, rFactor all fine. For AC I had mostly medium settings and 2xAA and was averaging around 130fps. I'm sure I couldn't run a lot of games on Ultra, though. AA seems to make the biggest impact, so only running 2xAA or FXAA makes a pretty big difference in some games."

0,"Brock Lesnar. Hell there are plenty of Heavyweight amateur wrestlers, heavyweight mma fighters and pro wrestlers that are around the 300 lb mark and fit.

Why not applaud the guy as he has clearly taken steps to make himself healthier and continues to do so."
0,"If I had to guess, repetitive enemies and (at times) poor camera angles when facing larger enemies is probably a factor. Difficulty might also be off-putting for some.

That, and for some reason I've seen some judge it with all the expectations of a full-fledged $60 AAA title, and not a budget title."
0,"So, let me put it to you this way... right now, you're looking at a high-end overclockable CPU (which you're spending extra for, by the way, without buying a cooler!?), and to go along with that you're buying a shit low-end video card. So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams.

Drop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that? Surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about $120-130 for a high-quality IPS LED), and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it.

If your intention is to play video games on this PC, you're making a big mistake. I urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance. You don't need to sacrifice a quad-core processor, just don't be getting the most expensive one of the bunch, it doesn't fit the rest of your specs.

Anyway... good luck."

0,"I was going to do a write-up on the state of out of body shields like Frost's Globe, Eximus mobile Globe and the Nullifiers shields. These abilities on the enemy are in my opinion a great addition to the game. I've been running massive amounts of T4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become. However, this is also because I have high RoF weapons in my T4 load out. The nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled Globes. This means, explosive munitions I.e. Penta nades, Ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players. Or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it. 

Another thing DE should consider is removing the damage limit on shields. Its pretty ridiculous how high RoF weapons are better against Nullifier shields (I've noticed this is only on Nullifiers) that slow high damage weapons. To put this into perspective, my Boltor Prime shoots spikes that deal ~800 damage to the nullifier shields. My opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag, 5 shots (~9 shots with multishot) to take the shield down. DE needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high RoF and slow RoF weapons to be viable.

An idea I've been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs. Blast procs can CC enemies inside the shield while Magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself. By introducing this mechanic, Void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons.


TL;DR 1) unify rules with regard to out of body shields. Players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own.

2) Remove damage limit on shields to make slow RoF weapons viable against nullifiers.

3) Add elemental weaknesses to the shields, bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void."

0,"/r/codcomp Waddup doe, SubHype here bka Devin.

I'm a 23 year old junior in college studying to become a software engineer while minoring in metaphysical philosophy at NIU.

My first COD, and first FPS game period actually was BO2. I know, I'm WAY late to the party but I followed that game very closely outside of competitive because it was new to me &amp; I'm too competitive to suck at something but not do something about it. Thanks to /u/Drift0r's in depth series I got a really good grasp on the how the game worked pretty quickly and am pretty much a stat junkie in every game I play now.

Ghosts was the first game I watched competitively, and I'm drained. I've watched 4 AW streams, just can't get into it like I was before :/

I'm actually a bigger Battlefield fan than COD &amp; I'm ironically a lot better at it too. I once ranked first in the state of Illinois in skill &amp; score per minute. I haven't played in months though so I'm sure my ranks have plummeted.

Outside of the FPS stuff I listen to a LOT of music (15 different genres and sub genres) &amp; watch sports constantly, my favorite being baseball (White Sox). That's pretty much me."

0,"First of all, thanks a bunch for the detailed response, I'm extremely glad to hear you liked my cards.

I deliberately made Arcane Unraveling do nothing in aggressive match-ups (although technically it could net value with Mad Scientist), because I think it is just insane in games that go to fatigue. All the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control, but 5 additional cards, 5 turns when you're not taking fatigue, seems absolutely insane to me. Also, this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with Secrets and have Mad Scientist-esque effects into the game. I'd gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card, but I think against control it could be insanely useful.

I think Shadow Summoner doesn't produce an insane amount of burn at all; you pay 9 mana just to get the first Shadow Bomber on board (6 for the card, 2 for hero power, 1 for the Bomber), and you can only Hero Power once per turn. If you have pressure to go along with it, then yes, it will do work, but on its own I don't think it's that strong at all.

For Tinkerer, I imagined this card less as a Jeeves (who simply allows any class to be zoo) and more like a mini-Gazlowe. I think if you even have two cards on board that generate Spare Parts (like a Gnome and Yeti) and you trade them in, this card gives you value. Two extra Spare Parts with Gazlowe or Antonidas or even Auctioneer is really good, and you're not paying too much to get them. 

Beastmaster can have synergy with Hunter cards obviously, allowing you to Houndmaster anything, enable Kill Command, etc. etc. This can let you do stuff like turn 4 Yeti turn 5 Beastmaster + Houndmaster, or turn 3 Harvest Golem turn 4 coin Beastmaster Houndmaster; basically it allows a work-around for there being a low number of good beasts in the game. It also synergizes with Druid of the Fang, I don't know if that's enough to make Beast Druid viable but I think it's worth considering. And, the most important part for me, it is a vastly superior Black Knight + Mark of the Wild with Hemet Nesingwary; a 6 mana Assassinate that also summons a 6/3 and a 2/1. 

Generator is insane if you can get value from it, but you have to run the Paladin secrets in exchange, which are pretty mediocre. And they won't get amazing value with the board state, except for Avenge; Redemption will be bad if they kill the Generator, Noble Sacrifice won't be spectacular, and the other ones will be garbage as usual.

I'll agree that Shadowy Archer is too strong; do you think making it a 1/2 would be fine (still better than Creeper, but it is a class card)?

For the Tortoise, it does seem limited, but I think in a deck with a lot of card draw, or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws, playing 2/2s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game. A comparison could be made with Hogger in terms of how 2/2 Taunts can snowball out of control. Also it's a Beast, though I don't know how useful that is.

I didn't consider the Shade comparison with Fel Imp at all, I think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker, when making it I was thinking of the synergy with Floating Watcher; you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once. Also with Blood Imp on board he grows faster than Shade as well, although not by much. He's probably a much worse play in the early game, but I think when you can play him and a few health-buffing effects immediately he shines.

For Neighborhood Blacksmith, I think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons, but then you can't use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have. And if you only get a few more charges, then he's pretty comparable to Greenskin;  with 1 minion, he's just worse, with 2 it's arguable (+1/+1 on the weapon but -2 Attack), so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better Greenskin. Which for current Warrior decks isn't that easy to achieve.

Thanks again for the response!"

&gt;We're failed except you.

you've only failed if you give up nofap. I'd like to post something that I posted on pornfree

""Well, I had been on a 7 day streak then I gave up. I was still motivated so I started again and went on a 22 day. Then I began doubting myself and what I was doing. I watched a few films in that streak and found myself enjoying scenes of sex *more* than usual. This caused it to snowball.

What helped immensely from that streak (my longest) is when an arousing thought hits you, **immediately** shut it down. Don't try to ignore it but rather tell it to fuck off and this next step is key to shutting it down: **move away from your previous room/activity** and do something else.
If you disagree with the thought but don't move away, it'll be like a drug addict telling himself he's going to the store when he's actually heading towards a trap house/drug house.  

I know myself better than anybody else. I find it hard to really register others' feelings when they're trying to motivate me so I made a video where I convince myself in a time of need, to move on. 

This is both to prevent procrastination and watching porn: I leave my phone across my room. Others choose to keep it across the house or in their safe but this is sufficient for me. I use an alarm and it forces me to stand up. Once I am up, I won't go back. 

Lastly, reward and recognise your achievements! Make a vague reward plan. After a week of my new life, I will treat myself to a mcflurry. On the second, I'll get a subway sandwich. On the third, a cinema visit and fourth, a new trouser. Something like that 

Never forget to reread your goals. **Never become complacent**.

0,"Hey!

I get your point.  unfortunately i think you either responded to the wrong topic or got confused - this post was about tight rulesets, not about balance, but you seem to use those interchangably.  You can make tight rules with an unbalanced system, or a balanced system with not tight rules.

If it was about balance, well, warmachine/hordes is one system that supports 14 full factions, and warhammer 40k has 18 (really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions).  fantasy doesn't have to be balanced against 40k so it's not included.  So the difference isn't so great.  unless you think the jump from 14 to 16-18 factions really breaks the camels back there, but i cant see it.




But back to the tight ruleset -  warhammer 40k's main rules problem isn't the vast number of rules.  It's not the minute rules interactions.  Really the core problem is the rules aren't written in a systematic fashion.

A systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system.

40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time, and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing, leading to confusion.

40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english.  Most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule, then they write it down in the confines of the rules set.

To use an example earlier today - ""a single passenger can fire out of each Fire Point"".  This is a poor rule as it stands, because the timing is not defined, and 40k doesn't even have a definition for what firing means.  do you ""Fire"" psychic shooting attacks?  Are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon?  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons?

A tighter defined rules set would have defined ""fire"" as making a ranged attack, and ranged attacks as psychic, shooting, etc.  It would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is.

To use an example from a comprehensive ruleset, in magic there's a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana.  In 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads ""All blue lands produce an extra mana"".  

That would be a terrible rule.  produce is not defined, it doesn't say when they make the extra mana (when they produce, do they produce two?  do they produce one now and one at the normal time?).  Theres just a lot of problems with that wording, you know this without even playtesting it.

Thats why magic words it ""Until end of turn, whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds Blue to his or her mana pool""   The timing is defined, tap is a defined term in the rules, everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset.

Just reading through different games' rulesets, you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned. 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend, not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from.  It's not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules, it's the way they are written.

Obviously no one expects something like this to happen, but puppies have no concept of social cues and can get into trouble suuuper easily (and not just with other dogs). If the roommate wasn't watching the puppy, the puppy should have been someplace safe where it wouldn't get into trouble (chewing on inappropriate items, going potty inside, etc). Similarly, OP should have crated his own dog if he knew Charlie had a history of snapping or knew that the puppy would be left unattended with him.

I'm not saying by any means that it's all the roommate's fault, but these were two dogs that should not have been alone with each other and both owners failed to keep them separated.

0,"""No organism is imaginary"" is my point.  We assume homo sapiens do not want their lives ended unless they explicitly say so.  The reason people oppose abortion is because they believe the organism being aborted is a homo sapien, and if it is a homo sapien then abortion is murder, which is something libertarians oppose.  The reason people oppose abortion is not because God said it is bad.  Therefore, the criticism against the opposition to abortion is itself based on something imaginary - a belief either no one or practically no one has.

Even if people believed that abortion was wrong simply because God said it was wrong, then that still would not justify opposing laws against abortion because otherwise we would have to oppose laws against murder given there are people who support laws against murder due to God saying it is wrong."

0,"&gt;In The Communist Manifesto, Marx predicted imminent revolution in Europe.
http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marx-publishes-manifesto
He also predicted it in advanced countries. Not only has this not happened, over 100 years later, but when attempted it was in backwards feudal countries. The attempts resulted in class based authoritarian command economies that failed.
The Manifesto summarised their analysis: the big battles between the feudal order and the bourgeoisie were imminent

1848 was a year of revolutions in Europe.
In 1871 the Paris commune was founded.
The russian revolution started in Russia's industrial centers, Moscow and St Petersburg, and this is where Bolshevicks had support. In the country side other socialists were far more popular.
At the same time there is an uprising or riots or whatever in Germany that is put down by SPD, at the time an officialy marxist party.

Marxism never really caught on in the anglosaxon world (there were cases when socialists would get up to 5 or 6% of the vote followed by ""Red Scares"", see Eugene Debbs or read the Grapes of Wrath for a closer look at that era) and it then got mixed with the anti-colonial movement that flourished in many less developed countries with economies based on agriculture.

But it's wrong to say that it applies on feudalism. Even today with communist parties far weaker in general you see them getting strong in industrial centers in a number of european countries."

Well, explain to me the differences in results then, because you haven't done so as of yet.

&gt;I am not sure what you are saying exactly.

You're saying that his post is wrong and is dismantled by switching to an opt-in system. However, the solutions to the questions that he asked have nothing to do with an opt-in system. In fact, they have to do with a system which actively compels everyone else to pick up the tab. 

&gt;This is a very poor argument. Someone who is sterilized may not want to pay taxes that give subsidies for families (someone else's child), yet they are forced to.

That's my point. You're arguing that forcing someone to pay for the child is wrong in one circumstance, but totally fine in another. The sterilized person hasn't opted-in to paying for the child, so, as per your framework, they shouldn't be forced to pay it."

TLDR: by going 1 mph slower than I suaully drive 11 hours a day I lose $250 per month. 

We don't do it because we're trying to save fuel. It's to get ahead of the driver plain and simple. 
The typical argument I hear on Reddit is how we should just stay in the lane so people in cars don't get held up from us passing. 
First off, fuck anyone who says that. It's fucking selfish. 
If I'm going 65mph on flat ground and another driver is going 64mph I'm going to go around him because I want to keep going 65 and not 64 just because people driving a car can't wait a minute while I pass someone. 
If the guy I'm passing does 64mph 11 hours a day he will do 704 miles. If he does that 5 days a week for a whole year that's 183,000+ miles per year that he's doing. 
Now I come along doing 65mph. Which using the same math I cover 2,000 more miles a year than him. 

On a typical day with my current outfit I make about $250 per day doing about 350 miles. So since I'm covering 11 more miles than him a day but I get stuck behind him doing 64 that means I'm losing $250 per month. 
Now he doesn't directly cause this loss of income because he's just trucking along minding his own business. But I'm losing money by going slower because I get less loads done per year going slower than I usually go. 
So regardless if someone is approaching I'll swing around him, get back up to speed, pass him and then move back over. And then you can go by no problem. 
Additionally, I don't want to stare at the back of a trailer I know I can pass. Anyone can agree with that. 

If you made it this far then that's good. Haha

0,"How powerful would he be? Very. Who could he take down? Unfortunately not very many before getting shut down. The problem is he still has Ock's personality, which is his weakness. Having ""no fear"" is a SEVERE liability. If you're reading Spider-verse, time shifted SSM just lost to Peter because he's so full of himself, he couldn't even conceive of having lost to Peter in his future that he assumed Peter was from the past. That kind of arrogance leads to failure quickly.

 I can see him getting full of himself on power, and planning on taking on more than he can handle (essentially exactly what happend when he got the symbiote and fought the Avengers) and immediately getting thrashed by someone severely out of his league. Shoot, that's kind of the entire arc of Superior Spider-Man straight through the end of Goblin Nation.

Now hypothetically who would he be strong enough to beat if it weren't for the terrible personality defects? Oh now that is a long list. Considering Peter's body on its own has beaten a herald of Galactus, It would be quite a force within the Marvel U with Extremis.

0,"&gt;it's also a great deal to do with patrol priority. 

So you're telling us that homicide, burglary, and rape are that far underreported among whites when compared to blacks? 

You really have no data showing blacks are patrolled more than whites. 

Perhaps you can point to specific departments who stopped blacks disproportionately in stop-and-frisks. But that's entirely different from the police state you make it sound like blacks live under versus a police-less society whites live under. 

&gt;the kid smoking a joint on the corner in a sleepy suburb is committing the same crime, but nobody's there to see or care, so the numbers stay low.

Let's go ahead and move forward with your thesis: let's ignore petty crime, like drug possession, entirely. Look at murder, rape, and burglary—you'll still see much higher numbers for blacks when compared to whites based on their overall population.

0,"NextGlass is a bit different though. If you scan the label (or search by name) of a beer/wine, it will tell you the likelihood that you will enjoy it based on a chemical analysis of beers/wines you have previously rated. 

So for example, if you are at the grocery store and you are not sure about a beer, you can scan the label and it will give you a score like 87.8% or 37.6%. which is just their guess at whether or not you will like it. I've played with it a little by scanning beers I know that I already know I like or dislike and and I think it does give make pretty damn good predictions once you've added enough reviews to your profile.

If you rate a beer/wine in their app, it won't tell you, ""If you liked this then you might like Beer X"" the way untappd does. It just stores that score data and uses it develop a profile for your likes and dislikes.




Their biggest shortcoming is that they actually have to have a sample of the beer/wine sent in for analysis to be able to rate it, so their database is lacking all but the more widely available and mainstream beers for the most part. It's still pretty new and growing though, and they claim to be constantly adding more and more to it. I think their scoring system is a little vague too (4 star system and you can't even give 0 stars) and I would like more depth to it like a score out 10 instead of 4. "

0,"I'm a bit rusty with my property law, but this is how I understand it. In a situation like this, the workers found property that would be considered mislaid property (as opposed to lost or abandoned property). Mislaid property is property that was put there intentionally by the owner of the property, and the owner for some reason forgets to retrieve it. The charges were dropped because the property at issue (the cash) belongs to whoever placed it there and forgot about it. Since the owner of the house is not the person who placed and forgot it, it is technically not his property (it actually still belongs to the person who placed it there in the first place). Since the owner of the house does not actually own the cash, he cannot be the individual to claim he was deprived of the property (since the property is not technically his).

 [**Welfare queen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare%20queen): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Welfare queen__ is a [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) phrase used in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America) to refer to people, usually women, who are accused of collecting excessive [welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_(financial_aid\)) payments through fraud or manipulation. Reporting on welfare fraud began during the early 1960s, appearing in general interest magazines such as *[Readers Digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers_Digest)*. The term entered the American [lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon) during [Ronald Reagan's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) [1976 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States\)_presidential_primaries,_1976) shortly after he described [a woman abusing welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Taylor) from [Chicago's South Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side_(Chicago\)), but he never used the term ""welfare queen"" when referencing the woman.

0,Well you clearly didn't know
0,"It just occurred to me that perhaps I didn't explain my reason for wanting it very well. This may fall on deaf ears now, and maybe rightfully so, but my interest was in allowing someone interested to explore more in depth, with the added benefit of fact checking. 

I just realized this after looking a thread on executive order and seeing a comment about it being ok because it still doesn't allow for allocation of funds. Great, that's probably true. But, selfishly, I would love to click on that and see a link to original rights bestowed to executive order.. then, you could get commenters talking about ways those initial right had been altered through precedents, which could again be linked. You could follow your way through that like wikipedia, but with more informed people showing you a path in which to search.

And that would be cool! I just hope you at least see my underlying desire for it, especially since you kept responding and then received a shitty answer from me. I'm not a total dick, I just wanted a cool way to learn a ton of information quickly. "
0,"Hmm. Saying something and expecting a particular response, in order to test the person, is a bad idea in general and I think it's especially bad if they're INTJ. We're good at picking up on that sort of thing and we don't like it. If we feel like someone's trying to manipulate us, we're likely to shut that person out.

We're direct and we expect other people to be. If you want to know whether he cares, ask, and believe his answer. And be open about your own feelings.

The ""I'm busy"" responses sound to me like an indication that he doesn't care much about you. You're just online friends, you've never met or spoken to each other? It sounds like he doesn't think it's a very close relationship. I don't know if this is common with INTJs but I don't feel very close with people I only know online. If someone online tells a sob story, I'll probably say something sympathetic just to be polite and I feel sorry for them just like I feel sorry for someone I read about in the news who's suffering, but I don't actually care like I would about someone I'm close with. INTJs take a while to warm up to someone, we tend not to have a lot of close friends. It sounds like you're expecting a high degree of emotional connection from someone who might just see you as an acquaintance or casual friend because he doesn't know you well enough yet. It's not a matter of you telling him more about your life, there's no way to force it. If you want to get closer with him then try to have more personal interaction like Skype or visiting. And if he's not interested in doing that then you have your answer."

0,"As a player trying to keep up to date and looking to get back into it knowing where the people are is the hardest thing. Especially since I'm playing from a Time zone very distant from the server I'm playing on. By the time I think to go on and just check it's already the time that there's no one on anyway.

Guild recruitment sites haven't been updated for several months if not all the way since July. The biggest issue I have with getting back into the game is working out, 'do I go back to my old characters or do I start over' and the biggest and toughest question with that is where to go and what to do to find other players and what to do to make friends.

Being away for so long and seeing the game as quiet as it is I just log on once in a while and roll about doing dailies (the very reason I left). And I don't even know if I'm gaining anything by that if I end up starting over on Exile side or the other server.

It upsets me that no one wants to put this information anywhere or even respond to asking questions. Yes, it's annoying, but as it is it's like no one wants new people in the game."

I had to get out and do a field sobriety test because I refused to blow, which is legal by the way. I failed the field sobriety test even though I feel I passed it. I wasn't drunk, my cognitive skills were functioning fine. 

He kept trying to get me to tell him how many drinks I had, I kept silent. I only gave answers to questions that could not be used against me. If I was drunk I wouldn't be that smart. We get to the station and I give blood. I have no idea what my BAC was. I had to blow to be released and about 30 minutes after I gave my blood it said .13. I am awaiting my actual BAC from the blood test. 

I didn't blow because I wanted the most accurate reading I could get. Even if I was over .08 I don't trust those machines, nor do I trust the law to not fiddle with them. I don't know if that is even possible but I still don't trust the machine. "

0,"Really enjoyed it thus far, i hope you intend to continue going scene by scene through the movie. One thing I'm not sure you touched on, and i assume would during the psychosis scene later, was the relationship between Olive and Caden, and Olive and Adele. You showed eaches reaction to her becoming upset at the idea of having blood, but their relationship itself wasn't talked about (if I'm remembering correctly). It always seemed to me that Adele wanted to push the responsibility of Olive onto Caden, yet when she leaves, she takes Olive with her. Almost as if she's enjoying the fruits of Olive's childhood, but leaving Caden to eat the rest. Further is the idea that Olive is in fact an extension of Caden, Adele can never escape Caden as long as Olive is with her, which to me comes back to the scene where Olive is afraid of the blood inside her. Caden tries to tell her that yes, she has blood (he wants to feel a bit of himself is in Olive), but Adele tells Olive that she doesn't have blood (saying Caden is not in Olive) which allows her to escape from Caden, with Olive, and not feel like, or able to deny, that Caden's work still lingers in the form of Olive."

The reason is that those are generally the ones you need to review the most. It's far more helpful to review those than easy skills up at the top of the tree.

On the other hand, if you abandoned the tree for a while or if you're reached a point where you're hopelessly lost, rather than deleting the tree and starting over, I suggest starting at the top of the tree and strengthening from there down.

0,"They had some restrictions on Steam Level that passed mostly under the radar for this event, I have to wonder if those might not be a test for bringing the coal (or something similar) back at some point.  It could present a way to stop people from making absurd numbers of alt accounts and farming achievements, that was the issue with that event wasn't it?  If they played the event out just as before, but with a minimum Steam Level to trade the relevant items (low enough to be widely accessible, high enough that you have to have had Steam for at least a little while), I think it would nip those issues in the bud.

I don't mind the cards so much because it's essentially free money to me, I've saved quite a bit of extra dosh over the course of this sale, and appreciate a handful of change off most of the games I buy.  The gems on the other hand, I don't really see them as useful or exciting to anyone except those who have invested extremely heavily in Steam trading.  If you run the conversion rates it's almost always advantageous to sell your cards to Russian money launderers instead.

I hope they get around to doing something different with the sale items you get too.  As it is they're very lackluster, being essentially a sub-par Steam sale you can use off-season.  It doesn't even particularly matter if they save you a ton of money, I'd just like them to be fun and interesting in some way."

Jake awoke to the rumbling sound of helicopters flying low over his house. Sitting up slightly and squinting through the haze of sleep, he looked at the clock on his nightstand. Instead of the glowing red numbers, there was only darkness. Then he checked his watch.

3:54 AM.
 
With a sigh he dropped back onto his pillow causing his wife to stir and mutter something unintelligible. Just then a searchlight swept across his yard illuminating his bedroom windows before moving on.

“Fucking Mondays.” He said aloud. Beside him his wife continued to sleep soundly despite the continuing noise. He rolled over and put an arm around her, smiling as he snuggled close to her warmth, envying her ability to sleep through anything. 

Then, over the drone of rotor blades, an announcement sounded in an amplified voice. “A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered to exit your homes, remain on your front lawn and await further orders.” The message began to repeat.
What? He thought, utterly confused. Everyone has to go outside? What’s going on? Begrudgingly he arose and walked to the window as a spotlight swept his house again. Down the street he could see several military vehicles as well as a few patrol cars with red and blue lights flashing. Several of his neighbors were already on their lawns looking sleepy and bewildered in their nightclothes. Then he noticed what looked like a greyhound bus being loaded. “What the?”

“What is it honey?” Sue asked having finally awoken and sat up.

“I don’t know. The police and the military are down the street and they are ordering everyone outside. It looks like they are loading people onto a bus.”

“The military? A bus?” She sounded incredulous. Then she heard the announcement amidst the cacophony. 

“A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered…” it continued. 

“They’re coming up the street!” Jake said. “They just kicked in Rob Merkele’s door!” His pulse quickened.

“They’re doing what?” Sue asked, still not fully awake.

“They’re dragging his family outside!” 

“Who? The police?”

“The military!” He turned from the window to face Sue. “Fuck this. I don’t know what’s going on but I don’t like it.”

“What are we going to do?” She asked.

He pulled the blinds back again but didn’t answer. The windows were shaking from the helicopters. “They just kicked the Hampton’s door in!”

By now Sue had gotten out of bed and was standing beside Jake looking out of the window.

“Get the kids up and get them in here.” He said.

“Right.” Said Sue and ran from the room and down the hall, turning lights on as she went.

Two more houses and they would be here. What to do? What to do? He thought about hiding places within the house. The attic. The back of a closet. The trunk of their car. Nothing was right. Should he just go along with this?

Sue came back with their two children Tom, 5, and Emily who was 7. They were on their feet but still mostly asleep. 

“Go grab a bunch of their clothes and any medicines they may need. We’ve only got a few minutes. They are almost here.” 

“What to do? What to do?” He kept asking himself aloud. Must he go along with whatever this was? How could they get away? Scanning his memory of the area, he remembered a drainage ditch beyond his property in the back yard that ran into a large tunnel. It was a chance.

Jake ran out of the room to find his wife. “Sue? Sue?”

“Yes?” The sound came from Emily’s room. 

“Sue! Quick, get them dressed as best you can and shoes on their feet, we are going to try to get out by the drainage tunnel behind the house.”

“The drainage tunnel? Is that safe?” She asked.

“It’s our only chance.”

She was still doubtful. “We don’t even know what’s going on. They may shoot us if we run. And if we do get away what then?”

It was obvious how scared she was as she was standing there in her nightgown, bundles of clothes in her arms.

There was a hard knocking at the front door. They both jumped at the sound. “Open up! Open the door!” Pound! Pound! Pound! There were several voices. “Everybody on the street now! Open up. Open the door or we will break it down!” Pound! Pound! Pound!

The look in her eyes as she shook her head no told him all he needed to know. She wouldn’t be running anywhere with the kids. For a moment they just stood there looking at each other in the midst of the chaos. Pound! Pound! Pound!

“Ok.” He said, and walked to open the front door.

There was a large crash as the door busted open. The cops or military men, he couldn’t tell, streamed inside. They were dressed in all black and their weapons were at the ready. 

“Police! Police!” they yelled as they progressed through the house. They came upon his family huddled on the bed in Jake and Sue’s bedroom.  “Everybody on the floor! Everybody down! Get on the floor!”

Jake was in front of his family, his arms spread wide covering as much of them as he could.

“On the fucking ground now!” The point man yelled. His weapon was pointed at Jake’s head where a red dot now bounced and jiggled. “Do it now! Do it now!”

Jakes heart sank. He was powerless. Here were a bunch of armed men threatening his family and all he could do was shield them with his body. Both of their children were sobbing as his wife held them.

“On. The. Fucking. Ground. Now!” The point man shouted. The other men behind him were now coming in and shouting orders and pointing their weapons. The point man grabbed Jake’s wrist and yanked him off of the bed, throwing him to the ground and putting a knee in his back. The second man in grabbed his wife’s wrist pulling her to the ground causing her to scream.

“Hey!” Jake shouted, pulling his head as far off of the ground as he could trying to see. “Stop hurting my wife!” His arm was grabbed, twisted behind his back and a handcuff was snapped around his wrist.

“Stop resisting!” the man on top of Jake yelled.

A third man came into the room, grabbed his daughter and threw her to the floor. She yelled as he did so and began crying loudly.

“Stop you motherfuckers!” Jake yelled. 

The person on top of him put an elbow into his face. “Shut up and stop resisting!” He twisted the other hand around his back preparing to cuff him. Spurred on by the cries of his family and without thinking, he tried to roll over but had no leverage. This prompted another elbow to the face. He tried throw the guy again. This time his left leg found purchase against the nightstand and he pushed. 

Under normal circumstances there would be little chance of anyone bucking a trained fully grown man off of their back, but this was a father protecting his family. A split second of superhuman strength was all that was needed to send him flying against the dresser. Flailing, the cop or whoever grabbed at a partially open drawer as he fell and brought the dresser down on top of himself. Jake, now on his feet, barely avoided the falling dresser as he lunged for the person on top of his wife at the foot of the bed.

He had his knee in the back of her neck and was preparing to cuff her when they made contact. Both went rolling. Jake ended up on the bottom. The man threw several punches and landed a few on Jake’s face, then paused and reached behind himself. Jake took a swing at the man’s face but his fist missed. The free end of the half fastened handcuff did not. It struck the man squarely in the cheekbone, making solid contact enough to break the bone and send blood pouring from his nose and cut onto Jake. That sent the man’s hands to his face as he let out what would have been, if not for the circumstances, a comically effeminate scream. Jake did not notice. All he knew was that the man was no longer trying to fight. Another swing and the handcuffs connected with his temple silencing him.

Jake struggled to his knees, pushing the man off of him and got to his feet. The other person clearing the house, hearing the struggle, now made his way down the hall and into the room. Seeing his one comrade holding his blood covered face and the other struggling to get a dresser off of him, he went into kill mode. He raised his weapon and pulled the trigger as Jake came at him. The sound was instant and sharp, quickly reducing the noise of his kids crying, the helicopters outside, everything, to a high pitched ring.

Jake did not feel the bullet pierce his midsection right below the sternum, was not aware of the .223 round’s tumble as it ripped through flesh and guts, spilling bile and blood where it should not go. Jake was only aware of the man in front of him at as his momentum carried them both to the floor. This time Jake was on top. Rage consumed him. Viciously he punched the man, trying to destroy him, his very existence. Over and over his fist made contact with the man’s face, nose, mouth. Teeth cut his knuckles which began to bleed. Blood splattered everywhere."

Different countries often recognize borders and sovereign countries. 

I expect that an atlas sold in Taiwan would be labeled slightly differently from one sold in mainland China for example and the Greeks and Turks might label Cyprus slightly differently. In Russian maps the Crimean peninsula is already included as part of Russia while much of the rest of the world portrays it as still belonging to the Ukraine. Whether or not a map includes Western Sahara probably depends a lot on who draws the borders on it.

Countries don't exist the same way mountains and lakes do. They are not indisputable features of geography, they are social constructs. If you are going to sell your maps in areas where certain countries or borders are not officially recognized it would be a good business decision to conform to the local official definitions rather those followed elsewhere.

Happened to me when I would come home from my university. Would have no hunger while not under the influence. The only bad part was that I got underweight (been a skinny kid my whole life), which is unhealthy. 

What I did to overcome it was, 1.) cut on smoking (like nights only), 2.) eat before you smoke (let the chemistry in your brain calibrate to be hungry while not high). Its gonna be a bit rough to get back there (takes 1-2 weeks w/ tolerance break)

Not that I've heard of, and certainly nothing that was universally applied. While the Inquisition was present across Europe their attitudes and techniques varied drastically based on location. Just about the only universal things were the *protections* that the Inquisition promised to the accused (beyond what the legal system at the time offered) and the format of the tribunal.

&gt;Was this proclamation issued as infallible?

No. Very few things have *ever* been defined infallibly, and in order to meet the requirements the Pope pretty much has to declare to the entire Church ""this thing I'm about to say is infallible!"" "

I only pop Archangel when I need to throw out Prayer of Healing / Cascade. I believe the guaranteed PoH crits from Empowered Archangel is more valuable than the bonus healing. If I don't see a time in the future where I'd be using those two spells, I'll just use it for the benefit of +25% healing.

0,"How about you ask me about something rather than make assumptions?   

I've been pretty clear and transparent.

My investment firm, Atlantic Financial, bought the company Fleetwood Video some years back and changed the name to FDVT or Fleetwood Digital Technology Corp.- I believe 2004 or so but I am not positive -- certainly quite a while back.  A family of a deceased business owner approached me and asked me to buy the business for what seemed to be a cheap rate.  I figured it had enough revenue to cover the purchase cost and some goodwill from being so old (founded in 1985) and the customer list and registration to do business with the government.

The company served the clients mentioned - mainly selling blank video tapes for security cameras.  That's pretty much what the business did.  One of the Atlantic Financial employees had plans to make it into more of a broad consulting company but we didn't.   

The company continued those services for a couple years as the contracts wound down and never worked in those areas again.  We considered pursuing some government business but didn't.  The company never asked for or got any new government contracts and the one part time employee who was on board with the aquisition moved on -- the internal employee working on it moved on.   The small amount of revenue that came in covered most of the costs of the purchase.  

I had thought that the business might have had value since it is a service disabled veteran business and I'm a disabled vet -- but I never used that certification or pursued those lines of business.  It's really not my cup of tea.  I had also considered using the business as a vehicle to help out a freind who is a martial arts trainer who had trained military and police - so he could run contracts through the business since it was registered in all the databases needed to do business with the government but it was too much effort relative to the reward.

We scrapped all the inventory, delisted all contracts with all government agencies and turned the shell of what was left into basically a catch all for web development and domain names we are afflicted with.   The company took on a couple small web consulting clients in later years.

At the time -- 2004 or so, I was not as adamantly against the government as I am now.  I had some interest in some types of government contracts -- I didn't pursue them but some of the work such as USAID efforts in Pakistan and security work interested me.  I didn't pursue it, it doesn't interest me now and I don't do any government work now.   Even the tiny bit of work that this company, which was owned by my company did was not something I was personally active in or profited from.

I am only giving so much information for full disclosure.   That client list is pretty similar for Google, Microsoft, Dell etc Etc.   The government buys a lot of stuff.   I don't like it, I don't prefer working woth government and I wish they were smaller.

Sure they do.

&gt;He contained gravity, that makes any sense to you? Can you explain that to me with logic?

It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. 

&gt; Magic making something that weights infinity, lighter, makes no sense to me either (in this particular situation), how much is infinity minus a million times a quadrillion tons? Still infinity!

Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension.

&gt;If they had magic that could make the book weight less than infinity, there is no difference from making it weight as much as a planet or a glass of water.

Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. 

Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. They can make magic compress infinite weight into a ""manageable"" weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight.

0,"Thanks for commenting again. The extra walls came after the additions to my previous base design. I've had great luck with my layout, even when I'm not sniped those who push have only achieved up to 50% except one guy who dropped a BK. The walls by my TH are aesthetic but the other serve WB purposes and the one in the middle was just to push them around into the bombs. My spring traps have launched more giants than my defenses have killed. The big bomb? Idk... I had extra wall pieces there like next to my cc but WB's haven't been a problem at all. Mass giants or mass archers have been the biggest threat. They drop em to take out that AD knowing they'll also take a crack at that vital ""exposed"" wall piece. After the AD is gone they throw out a healer which my balloons and archers dispose of. 

I like finally getting to discuss my base with someone! Keep the suggestions and advice coming. If I pushed my ad behind walls say where the BB is, any advice for the BB? I've tried many layout edits to fit it in the middle but was never happy. I just recently swapped my mortars with my elixir storages. Glad I did. But idk what to expect after this wall grind.

* works with the keyboard dock
* doesnt have charging problems
* doesnt have battery drain issues
* still in some state of development so that bugs might have a chance of being fixed

The 3 that I've found that seem to be most discussed are:

* zombi-x: http://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-prime/development/rom-t2920306
* crombi-kk: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2773812

Katkiss is a lollipop backport from the TF300T, which sounds promising, but seems to have screen sleep problems, battery problems etc.. Crombi seems to be the most used, but I keep reading how it just doesnt play nice with the dock, which is essential for me.

0,"I understand what you mean, but it is not like you are saying. Running lean is a vague term. You have a temperature peak around the stœchiometric of the fuel. The peak begins before lambda and ends after lambda. The danger here is that running a tad bit leaner than lambda will increase combustion temperature. If you continue to lean, there will not be enough fuel to produce heat thus the peak goes down. 

What I am saying is that it is difficult without proper engine monitoring to determine if you are passed the heat peak or not. CHT temp is critical IMHO. because the head gets less oil and is only cooled by air, the only other way to keep it cool is to run richer. The unburnt fuel will drop the combustion temperature at the cost of producing more undesirable by-byproduct. 

The only fuel that I know that will burn hotter when richer is the Diesel and alike (jet fuel and such). They are totally different than 100LL. "

0,"&gt; Even if it does change, why was Massachusetts on there anyways? Is it just a coincidence its where Reddit is based, 

Not entirely sure what youre asking so this might not be the answer youre looking for: Essentially it is just a coincidence, A858 has various timezones it uses, one of those happens to fall in line with Massachusetts. The important factor is its controlled by the bot itself and likely has absolutely no relation to where the bot is located in real life.

&gt; how the reason why nothing has been solved yet is because there is nothing to solve

Plenty of things have been solved, take a look at this list: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/posts

Some of them are not yet completely solved however eventually they will be. It is clear that the owner of the bot is aware that we are solving these codes and are specifically putting out puzzles - hence why theres no way its used to test reddit. 

If youre wondering why the bulk of it isnt being solved is because its not yet possible. There are clues in the easier puzzels which give information on how to solve the main bulk. The working theory is those messsages you see being posted constantly are actually part of groups and are more than likely encrypted. There is no way of outright breaking the encryption (or incredibly low chance) so we rely on solving the other puzzels to even be able to think about trying to solve those. 

&gt;there might just be a certain pattern to the random strings generated (e.g on letters a-f are included)?

The pattern you are seeing is HEX encoding. Essentially hex is any 0-9 A-F (Where A = 10 and F = 16).  Hex is a way of displaying non-text(non ASCII) data in a human readable format.

0,"Here's something: 

The more modest you dress, the more holy you become and appear, the more attractive you will be to some. In fact, bad people might even see modesty as a target. So the propositions might not actually go down, they might increase. People can spot ""goodness"", and depending on their own state they will react accordingly. This is a harsh truth, but I have had it confirmed by others. 

People who value goodness and respectfulness will not see you as a target no matter what you are wearing. Just use your sense and dress respectfully."

Exercise, observe the world around you, talk to and engage with strangers on the street (even if it's a simple ""hello""). Join a club, a gym or do yoga. These are all things you can do that will (A) help your body feel good which put you in a good frame of mind and (B) get you out and meet people. Remember, you cant find happiness in possessions, be it a husband, a puppy a car or anything else. You need to search for happiness within - it is after all a state of mind."

0,"Absolutely liquidate. Our bank's PB is not in the business of taking a hit/loss because we let a client blow through their margin. This is the response to the asset declining significantly in value, not necessarily the same thing as ""rates rising"".  There is also no guarantee a firm will pay its obligations on the debt (especially on jr unsecured or other lower priority tranches). In the event of catastrophic failure of a credit portfolio, the hedge fund can declare bankruptcy, wipe their hands clean, and owe us nothing beyond the liquidation value of the fund (and at 5x leverage, ""catastrophic"", where we could potentially incur a loss, would be a 20% hit in equity of the portfolio). Any deficit between that and the margin they posted would be our bank's loss.  Likewise, if they were to walk away from a negative margin equity portfolio, it could potentially take days (or weeks) to liquidate positions of a hedge funds size.  During this time, the liquidation could accelerate the market to move against the assets thus forcing greater losses on the bank.

This is why liquidity considerations are part of the margining methodology. In stocks we look at multiples of 100x avg daily trade volume. With credit we're concerned with % of outstanding issuance as well as # of available executable pricing sources (from appropriately sized dealers) and frequency of those broker quotes. 

This generalizes your question though. Credit portfolios don't inherently suffer when rates rise. There are plenty of floored and variable coupon and step coupon corp bonds out there that are intrinsically lower duration. "

0,"I've seen them in a lot of medical places, but not in the places with the highest quality of bud. Honestly each place has a different definition of caviar and there are so many variables:

Is BHO used at all and what quality is that, really? nobody is using the 60/g nug run shatter for caviar.

What quality is the kief? If it is just farmer's grade dry sift it can easily be 50-70% contaminant or more (read: not many trichome heads) and is often added to lower quality bud to make it seem more resinous. 

What quality is the bud? Is there variation between the different layers? How goddamn expensive is it and how do I smoke this thing?

I think of it as a way for dispensaries to combine excess or unwanted material into a desirable product. I'd much rather have high quality bubble, flower, and oil separately over paying a premium for a mystery. It's kind of a tourist trap, you'll never see someone buy a gram of full melt and a gram of caviar at the same time.

0,"From what I can understand the rationale for the price reduction has nothing to do with helping people get more drunk during the recession. It's to stop people who can't afford to consume the legal vodka from purchasing illicit supplies.

The government in the past decade has been increasing taxes on it and implementing stricter rules. It's reduced consumption and deaths by a third so far. However the downside to this is that illicit vodka is becoming more common for those who can't afford the prices.

This has been a problem for some time now.

http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/07/17/russias-vodka-tax-backfiring/
&gt; As many experts – and drinkers – warned from the start, high taxes on alcohol have driven hard-drinking Russians to seek out cheaper, illegal sources of booze. Vodka makers complain that they can no longer compete with a thriving black market offering cut price liquor and moonshine.

http://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/21-11-2012/122882-vodka-0/
&gt; According to official figures, the volume of vodka sold on the Russian market doubles the amount of produced vodka. In 2011, the statistical difference was 40 percent. Factory counterfeit products, produced in the ""fourth shift"", are available in all cities of Russia and take about one-third of the market - one billion bottles.


It's right for the government to take action on Vodka consumption and illicit production. Russia has sorted it's self out from being the demographic basketcase it was, however there are still to many Russians dying unnecessarily. Unless they can stop police and officials from turning a blind eye on the illicit production, raising taxes won't do much. 

They need to take a more long term approach. The way the UK does when it comes to stopping drinking and driving and smoking. Hard hitting ads, NGOs and youth groups that spread awareness, large alcohol free zones that makes drinking inconvenient and etc.

At this point it's a societal issue and not something that can be solved by higher taxes."

3) Drink a lot of water. Just like the cardio this may help flush your system. And if not you'll at least be hydrated. 

4) Drink and obscene amount of water on the day of the test. Most urine test measure the amount of toxins within the urine. Over a certain threshold it what triggers a failure. By drinking more water you effectively delude your urine. It's kinda like if you were to half the cup up with water before you pee in it. (Don't fill the cup with water tho. That's an instant fail)"

Then they sell it for one of two reasons:

1. They want the newest, hottest supercar.
2. They realize they don't really drive it (or, can't really afford it).

Of course, by this time it's depreciated quite a bit so you get a deal.

Go look at the ads, you'll see four year old Ferraris with less than 10,000 miles."

Personally, I see assault as more of the lax mode, since victory can very well hinge on what team rolled a more solid comp, so there's no reason to take it as seriously as arena where you can actually choose your god."
